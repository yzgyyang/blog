As a hello-world-class coder, this is my go-to line for celebrating my first attempt on every new language I learnt, every new technology I tried and each and every platform I used.

"Your English is pretty good!", they said. It took me some time to figure out that people say that as a compliment when they noticed I was “good enough” but had not yet mastered the language. I can't wait to keep developing my skills till there is no appreciable trouble.

This blog will be my thoughts gathering place for ideas, code, photos, experiences, and more. There's an old Chinese saying that states "The faintest ink is better than the best memory". I hope that I can post something here at least once a month. There is completely no pressure for me though, so don't count on that.

Anyway, `hello world`!
